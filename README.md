### FAQ

  Q. Don't see your program in the Code Coverage report?

  A. There might have been some problem in saving the program in the 'src' directory. Please save each class INDIVIDUALLY in the 'src' directory. If your program uses 2 classes, say class Hello{} and class World{} save them as 2 separate '.java' files in the 'src' directory. 
If the above is ensured, then make sure there are no errors in your given code.
